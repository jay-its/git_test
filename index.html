    <h1>Recap Yuh</h1> 
    <p>This whole thing is just for recap purposes. It's probably going to look ugly.</p>
    <p>But my goal is to get through recapping HTML and CSS as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>TBH, I already feel pretty confident picking it back up.</p>

    <!--I should probably include an HTML comment
        I wonder if there is a VSCode shortcut for comments-->                          
        <!-- yes there is! -->

        <!-- Its ctrl + /  -->
             <!-- or i think i can type a whole line and then highlight
                    it all and press ctrl shift a --> 
    <p>This is to prectice <strong>bold</strong> words, <em>italics</em>, and nesting.</p>
